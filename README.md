## Project Description

PhenoHive is a low-cost station for plant phenotyping.

The design is based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W running on DietPi OS with:
- A Tal226 load cell connected to a HX711 controller to measure plant weight.
- A Raspberry Pi Camera and a LED lightning strip connected to a KY-019 relay module to take pictures of the plant.
- A ST7735 LCD screen and two buttons to interact with the user.

The software is written in Python, with a [bash setup script](setup.sh) to set up the system.
The Python code is divided in five files:
- [main.py](main.py) is the main file, it initialises the system and handles the user interactions as well as the different pipelines.
- [PhenoStation.py](PhenoStation.py) contains a singleton class that handles the hardware interactions. It contains the different variables and methods to take pictures, measure weight, and communicate with the database.
- [image_processing.py](image_processing.py) contains the different functions to analyse the plant images and compute its growth.
- [show_display.py](show_display.py) contains the different functions to display the information on the LCD screen.
- [utils.py](utils.py) contains two functions, one to set up the logger used by the system, and one to compute the growth of the plant.

## System Operation

### Configuration

Each variable of the station, such as the different pins of each sensor,
the time interval between each measurement, etc. is set in [config.ini](config.ini).

### Initialisation

Once the system has been set up (see [Installation](#installation) for more details), [main.py](main.py) will be run at startup.
It will initialise the logger, instantiate the PhenoStation class, and start the main loop.
At this point, it will display the main menu on the LCD screen and either:
- Wait for the user to press "Start" to enter measurement mode or "Config" to configure enter the configuration menu.
- Automatically start the measurement pipeline if the system unexpectedly shut down in measurement mode.

### Configuration Menu

The configuration menu allows the user to:
- Tare the load cell in the "Calib" menu.
- Ensure that the camera is correctly positioned in the "Prev" menu (this menu can be exited by pressing the right button).

### Measurement Mode

#### Measurement pipeline

The measurement mode is divided in several pipelines to improve modularity and ease of use:
- the picture pipeline takes a picture of the plant, saves it [data/images](data/images), and displays it on the LCD screen.
Then, the picture is analysed using plantcv to compute the growth of the plant (see [image_processing.py](image_processing.py)).
- the weight pipeline measures the weight of the plant, by taking the median of several measurements to avoid abnormal values.
- the database pipeline sends the different measurements to the InfluxDB database. The measurements are also saved in a CSV file in the [data](data) folder to avoid data loss in case of database failure.

#### Display and status

The different steps of the pipelines are displayed on the LCD screen to inform the user of the system status.
A status menu is also available when the system is not in a pipeline to display the station's status.
Furthermore, the display will show a colour outline at all times to inform the user of the system status:
- Green: the system is nominal.
- Blue: the system is nominal but not connected to the database.
- Yellow: the system is in a pipeline.
- Red: the system encountered an error. The error message and time will be displayed on the status menu.

#### Measurement format

The different data sent to the database and saved in the CSV file are:
- "weight": the weight of the plant (raw value without a conversion to grams).
- "weight_g": the weight of the plant (in grams if the calibration coefficient was set using [tools/calibration.py](tools/calibration.py)).
- "standard_deviation": the standard deviation of the weight measurements.
- "growth": the growth of the plant (in pixels).
- "picture": the picture of the plant (in base64 format).
- "status": the status of the station.
- "error_time": the time of the last error. 
- "error_message": the last error message.

### Logging and error handling

The system logs are saved in [logs](logs) folder, with the time and date of the log as the filename. If the logging level is not given as argument when starting the station, the default level is DEBUG.

When an error occurs, the system will register the error message and time using the `register_error` method of the PhenoStation class.
The error message will be logged, displayed on the LCD screen, and the status will be set to red.
Critical steps, such as when collecting the weight or taking a picture, will be wrapped in a try/except block to catch any error and register it.
However, unexpected errors can still occur. In this case, the system will try to catch and register the error, but if more than 10 unexpected errors are encountered, the system will raise a RuntimeError and restart (if the [phenohive.service](tools/phenohive.service) is set to restart on failure).

## Installation

The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with DietPi OS.
The system was tested with DietPi v9.6.1 (released in 2024-07-07).

To install the system, you can either:

10. Run the [calibration script](tools/calibration.py) using `python3 tools/calibration.py` to calibrate the load cell (warning: this will overwrite the previous calibration coefficient).
11. Reboot the Raspberry Pi using `reboot`, the PhenoHive service will start automatically at boot.
12. The system is now running; you can check the status of the service using `systemctl status phenohive.service`.

### SSH connection

1. Make sure that you are connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi.
2. Find your current IP using `ifconfig /all` (on Windows or macOS) or `ip a` (on Linux).
   - You should see an IP address in the form of `192.168.1.X`, `10.42.0.X` or similar.
   Example output of `ifconfig /all`:
   ```bash
   PS C:\Users\goffi> ipconfig /all
    [...]

   ```
   - If your IP is, for example `192.168.34.17`, than your IP range is `192.168.34.0/24`.
   In the above example, the IP is `192.168.166.254`, so the IP range is `192.168.166.0/24`.
3. Find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi:
   - Using [nmap](https://nmap.org/), scan the network using `nmap -sn <YOUR_IP_RANGE>` (replace `<YOUR_IP_RANGE>` with your IP range found at step 2).
   - The Raspberry Pi should appear in the list with "Raspberry Pi Foundation" next to the MAC Address, its IP will be just above.
   - Example:
   ```bash
    PS C:\Users\goffi> nmap -sn 192.168.166.0/24
    Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-17 09:47 Paris, Madrid (heure dÆÚtÚ)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.166.16
    Host is up (0.013s latency).
    MAC Address: B8:27:EB:BF:6D:1A (Raspberry Pi Foundation)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.166.254
    Host is up (0.017s latency).
    MAC Address: 4E:A5:88:52:12:F3 (Unknown)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.166.174
    Host is up.
    Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 2.92 seconds
   ```
   Here, the Raspberry Pi has the IP `192.168.166.16` (the first in the list).
4. Connect to the Raspberry Pi using SSH with `ssh root@<RASPBERRY_PI_IP>` (replace `<RASPBERRY_PI_IP>` with the IP found at step 3).
Enter the password when prompted (default: phenohive).
5. You can close the connection at any time using `exit`.
